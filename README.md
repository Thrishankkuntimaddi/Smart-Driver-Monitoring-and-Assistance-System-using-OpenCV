# Smart Driver Monitoring and Assistance System using OpenCV

This repository hosts a Python script for a Smart Driver Monitoring and Assistance System. The system utilizes computer vision technologies, including OpenCV, dlib, and Twilio integration. The script monitors a driver's facial landmarks in real-time to detect signs of drowsiness, closed eyes, and inattention. It provides on-screen visual alerts and, optionally, sends SMS notifications using Twilio for prompt intervention. Users can clone the repository, install necessary dependencies, and customize detection thresholds and Twilio credentials in the main.py script. The project is open-source, fostering adaptability and collaboration for further enhancements in smart driver assistance and safety.
